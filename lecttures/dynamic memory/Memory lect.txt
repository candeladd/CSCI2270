dynamic memory allocation
    *read txt from file, you don't know the size of txt

    graphs- free up memory for new connections/ allocations
        vectors can do allot of this work under the surface
        trapped on a desert island how would you do this w/o vectors
    MEMORY backGround
        stack - local variables, memory management done for you
        heap -  large pool of free memory (much larger than the stack)
                this is where dynamically allocated variables go.
                *memory management is done by you(in C++)
